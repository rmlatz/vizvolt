##User Stories

A user should land on a homepage and be presented with a dynamically generated D3 donut chart displaying the proportions for each fuel used to generate electricity in the US in 2013.

A user should have the option to select a state and year on the homepage and be redirected to a new dynamically generated D3 donut chart for proportions of fuels used for electricity generation in that state for that year.
